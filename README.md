Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset, one of the most well-known datasets for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The project focuses on data cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into survival rates, passenger demographics, and other key trends.

Dataset Details
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, age, gender, class, and more.

Key Attributes:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Addressed missing values in columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Converted categorical variables (e.g., Sex and Embarked) into numerical format for analysis.
Removed irrelevant features and standardized data formats.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored survival rates across various features like Pclass, Sex, and Age.
Analyzed relationships between passenger demographics and survival probability.
Identified patterns in ticket fares, family size, and port of embarkation.
3. Visualization
Created insightful visualizations using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn:

Bar Charts: Survival rates by gender and class.
Histograms: Age distribution of passengers.
Heatmaps: Correlation between features.
Boxplots: Fare distribution across classes.
Results and Insights
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
Class: Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive compared to those in 2nd or 3rd class.
Age: Younger passengers had higher survival rates.
Fare: Higher ticket fares were associated with higher survival probabilities.
